BLAZE - a slick slider fork for 100% Google Lighthouse Performance Score
-------

[1]: <https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick>

#### Original Repo

[http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

#### Purpose

Make Google Lightouse happy by fixing the root cause of the "add support for passive listeners" issue and some other improvements in regards of speed. Add SEO value. Bump up colorful marketing charts for management with more pagespeed (normally raises the Lighthouse score by 7 to 8 points).

This fork is 100% compatible with vanilla slick slider, you can just switch to blaze and be done.

#### Install

```
npm install nicolaskopp/blaze
```

#### Usage

Please refer to [https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/#getting-started](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/#getting-started), follow the instructions there.

Note: Albeit this fork is called "blaze" for better recognition, you just use "slick" everywhere inside your code as usual.

#### Security Note

It is absolutely safe to use my fork (at the time of me writing this), however, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to keep my fork up to date with all bug- and security-fixes of the original branch (<https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick>) in the future. I will check the main branch regularly and merge changes, but it is not my focus to be a maintainer. This means that it's quite possible that there will be security updates in the main branch, which I will not integrate in my fork immediately, or at all. At the moment, it should be pretty safe to use. Thanks for considering this fork!
